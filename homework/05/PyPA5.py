class printf(FormattedString):
    """NAME
      printf - format and print data

SYNOPSIS
      printf ([FORMAT [ARGUMENTS]] )

DESCRIPTION
      Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT string

      If no FORMAT string is given, do nothing.
      If no ARGUMENTS are given, then FORMAT must contain no format specifiers.


      FORMAT controls the output similar to the C language's printf. Compared
      to a C printf(), however, there are some differences in the format codes
      (eg, a %z is added, but there is no %g).

      Compared to a Python print statement, some datatypes print differently,
      because unicode symbols are used to indicate certain data types.

      The format specifier data types are either numeric or containers.
      - Numeric types:
          %B - (B)oolean type. Answer is "True" or "False". Format follows the
               string rules: printf("|%-6B|%+6B|",True,1==2) ü°Ü |True  | False|
          %f - (f)loat type. Format options are the same as C printf. So, for
               example, printf("|%-+08.3f|",1.2)  ü°Ü  |+1.200  |
          %i - (i)nteger type. Format options are the same as C printf. So, for
               example, printf("|%-+08i|",12)  ü°Ü     |+1      |
          %j - complex type. No paretheses are put around complex numbers. 
               The format options will be described by cases:
               -Concerning the real part, it prints if it is nonzero, or if a +
                is used:  printf("|%j|%j|%+j|",1,1j,1j) ü°Ü |1+0j|1j|0+1j|
               -Concerning the formating of the real and complex parts, they
                use the same format: printf("|%+03j|1+2j) ü°Ü |001+002j|
               -Concerning the formating of the real and complex parts, they
                use the same format: printf("|%+03j|1+2j) ü°Ü |001+002j|
               -Concerning whether to print as an integer or a float, that is
                determined by the presence of a '.' in the format:
                printf("|%3j|%4.1j|",1.1+2.2j,1.1+2.2j) ü°Ü |  1+  2j| 1.1+ 2.2j|

      - Container types. These all follow the format rules of strings:
          %D - (D)ictionary type. It displays with surrounding symbols: ¬´...¬ª.
          %L - (L)ist type. It displays with surrounding symbols: [...].
          %s - (s)tring type. It displays with no surrounding symbols.
          %S - (S)et type. It displays with surrounding symbols: {...}.
               Note: the empty set displays as {}.
          %T - (T)uple type. It displays with surrounding symbols: (...).
               Note: a singleton tuple doesn't print a comma after the element.
          %y - bytearra(y) type. It displays with surrounding symbols: ‚Äú...‚Äù.
          %z - fro(z)enset type. It displays with surrounding symbols: ‚¶ì...‚¶î.
          %B - (B)ytes type. It displays with surrounding symbols: ‚Äò...‚Äô.
          %a - (a)ny type. Converts the argument to a string then uses string 
               rules to print. For example:
                 printf("|%-10a|%10a|",1,{1:2}) ü°Ü |1         |    ¬´1: 2¬ª|

      There is also a special use of % to not indicate a format string:
       - "%%" - This not a format string, but just the way to print a "%".  """

    def __init__(self,fstr,*args,noprint==False):
        """We want the formattedString base (ie, super) class to have access
        to the format string and the arguments. So we will need to use the
        super() function to invoke formattedString's __init__ from inside this
        current method (ie, inside of the __init__ for printf).
        If formattedString's __init__ doesn't crash, then the input must have
        been good.
        The next step is to print myself, unless noprint was passed in as true.
        Note: Since formattedString is a base class, and since the printf class
              doesn't have a __str__ function, the __str__ will be inherited,
              and so the print will work.  """
