    """This receives a single format string, a variable-length argument, and a	
       special keyword-only variable with the default value of a singleton list	
       holding the number 0.	
       -In saying "a single format string" we mean that the string begins with 	
        a "%" and ends with a letter, with no letters or "%" in the middle.	
          (But there are two special format strings: "*" and "?". A "*" 	
           indicates that a new printf() has begun, so that the counter needs 	
           to reset to 0.	
           A "?" indicates that this printf() has finished, so we need to check	
           for unmatched extra objects in the provided list.)	
       -As for the variable-length argument, it holds all of the arguments you	
        give to printf(), beyond the first argument, which is a format string.       	
       -What is the special variable? In slides 76-90 of Lecture 6, we learned	
        that mutable default types persist between calls to a function. So the	
        value of 0 in this list can be update to 1, 2, 3, etc. and that change	
        will persist.	
        Thus, we can look into this value to find the index in the variable-	
        length argument tuple.	

        Now for the behavior:	
        - If the format string is finished (ie, you receive a "?"), but the	
          argument list is not completed (ie, the counter held in the special	
          variable has not reached to the end of the variable-length argument	
          tuple), then you print an error message and then exit().	
        - If the argument list is finished, but there is a new format string,	
          print an error message and then exit().	
        - Copy the next value in the variable-length tuple to the name "me". 	
        - If the format string ends in "a" and if the variable named "me" 	
          holds a number, then convert into a string. Note: you must use the	
          dictionary defined on Line #1 to do this. 	
        - If the format string ends in "a" then use the dictionary defined on 	
          Line #2 to replace the "a" with the appropriate letter for the 	
          datatype of the variable "me". Note that if "me" had been a number, 	
          it would by now be a string.	
        - If the datatype of the value stored in "me" is a number, then call	
          handleNumbers(). Otherwise, call doIfMatches().                   """

       argument, looking for "%" symbols. When one is found, we keep looking	
       to find the next letter. The characters in between are a single format 	
       string. We can then call fprint() to handle the printing of this current	
       argument.	
       There are some considerations:	
         - "%%" is not a format string, but just the way to print a "%".	
         - In calling fprint(), it needs to be initialized first, by passing in	
           a "*". This is because we may do more than one printf().	
         - When finished, we need to call fprint() again with a "?" to ensure
